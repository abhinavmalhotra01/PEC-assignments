// Answer 1:

/*

In "In-Place" sorting algorithm the space complexity
lies between O(1) and O(logn) both included.

On the other hand, for "Out-Place"  sorting algorithm needs extra space to put the elements in as it's sorting them.
Usually this means O(n) extra space


Hence , In-Place uses a small extra space and changes the input array itself
whereas, Out-place uses extra space to perform the algorithm

// Answer 3:

/*
	In-place technique is better suited for solving problems that require 
	one to solve the problem without using extra space.
	for example :
				 we are assigned the duty to sort the list of marks of students in ascending order
				 now , if we implement changes in the original dataset itself as in the case of insertion sort
				 this way, we dont have to create any new dataset , however it may be difficult to implement the algorithm

	Out-Place technique is better suited for solving problems , where we are not much concerned about 
	using extra space 
	for example :used recursion to solve it then a stack of n space would also be used
				 we would have chosen out-place , in this case the implementation of the algorithm is comparatively easier
				 merge sort is one such algorithm that uses out-place technique and is widely used due to less time complexity however , its' space complexity is O(n) as expected
