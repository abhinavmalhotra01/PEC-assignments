// BINARY SEARCH

/* bianry search works only on sorted array ( whether increasing or decreasing ) */
/* In the given problem , since the size is unknown , we cant know the right(max_index) value for the search 
In order to solve this problem, we will use a modified binary search 

Firstly , we will find an index i such that k < A[i] and then do binary search from 0 to i
Now, since A[i] > k and all elements above i will be greater than or equal to A[i] hence there is zero possibility that k will be founded there

To implement this , initially we will set left = 0 and right = 1
now if k > A[right]  // means we need to go further than right index to find greater values (and potentially k)
right = right*2 // double the search range 
and now we can do normal binary search on arr[left] to arr[right] to find element k*/

		{
			right = mid - 1;  // reducing our search space
			mid = (left + right)/2;  // updating mid 
		}

		else if(arr[mid] < z)
		{
			left = mid + 1;  // reducing our search space 
			mid = (left + right)/2;  // updating mid
		}
		else
		{
			return mid;  // thjis means that the value has been found so we simply return it
