// Bonus Question :
/*
Try to find a way to link the family members' doubly-linked list based on their relationship. (Is it possible?)

--

*In my opinion, in order to link the nodes with respect to the relation , we can take the relaion as the input and while inserting \
 may link the nodes wrt to the relation , in this view, a family graph might bge created
	*another way can be to take the input in form of the levels of a family tree , ie, taking the input generation wise and insetring the nodes
	 in the list order-wise as in an generic tree
		*anothet observation can be, the avreage age of one genratoon has to be  greater than its successors (although , this approach might have some exceptions)
