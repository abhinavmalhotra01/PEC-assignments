Enter the size of array : 4

Enter the elements of the array: 9 54 6 2

Comparison between Insertion and Bubble sort :

1. On the basis of number of comparisons :  Both require equal number of operations.

2. On the basis of number of swaps :  More swaps are required for bubble sort.

3. As both Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are in-place algorithms, hence both of their In-place Algorithm have been written above.
